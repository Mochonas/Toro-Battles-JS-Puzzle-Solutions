We failed this attempt because of an incorrect assumption

We assumed that the problem statement "any move they make is without knowledge of what the other robot is doing" implies that the robots:

(1) Do not know the other robot's final (x,y) coordinates in the unit circle
(2) Do not know the other robot's strategy

We were correct about 1, but the opposite of 2 was true.
